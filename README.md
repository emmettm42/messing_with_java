# messing_with_java
Hi reader. 
I'm Emmett, a CS Student.
These are some Java programs I've written over the years, collected here for posterity.
I started learning Java in 2016 at SUNY Potsdam. 
I then used it at Nassau Community College in our Data Structures & Algorithms class.
I've also taught classes in Java through iD Tech Camps and private tutoring.

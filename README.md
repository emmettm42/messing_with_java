# messing_with_java
Hi reader.<br>
I'm Emmett, a CS Student.<br>
These are some Java programs I've written over the years, collected here for posterity.<br>
I started learning Java in 2016 at SUNY Potsdam. <br>
I then used it at Nassau Community College in our Data Structures & Algorithms class.<br>
I've also taught classes in Java through iD Tech Camps and private tutoring.<br>
